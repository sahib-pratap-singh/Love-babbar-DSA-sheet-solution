<h1>:heavy_check_mark: Cyclically rotate an array by one</h1>
<blockquote>Given an array, rotate the array by one position in clock-wise direction.</blockquote>

* **Example 1**:<br>

        Input:
        N = 5
        A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
        Output:
        5 1 2 3 4

* **Example 2**:<br>

        Input:
        N = 8
        A[] = {9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1, 3}
        Output:
        3 9 8 7 6 4 2 1

**âž” Your Task**

      You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function rotate() which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and modify the array.
