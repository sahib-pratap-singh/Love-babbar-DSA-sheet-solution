<h1>:heavy_check_mark: Move all negative numbers to beginning and positive to end with constant extra space</h1>
<blockquote>An array contains both positive and negative numbers in random order. Rearrange the array elements so that all negative numbers appear before all positive numbers.</blockquote>

* **Example 1**:<br>

        Input: -12, 11, -13, -5, 6, -7, 5, -3, -6
        Output: -12 -13 -5 -7 -3 -6 11 6 5


**âž” Your Task**

      You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function rearrange() which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and returns the minimum and maximum element of the array.

### **Constraints** 
    1 <= N <= 10^5
