<h1>:heavy_check_mark: 287. Find the Duplicate Number </h1>
<blockquote>Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.</blockquote>

* **Example 1**:<br>

        Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
        Output: 2

* **Example 2**:<br>

        Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
        Output: 3



### **Constraints** 
    1 <= n <= 10^5
    nums.length == n + 1
    1 <= nums[i] <= n
    All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.
